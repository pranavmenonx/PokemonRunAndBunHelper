When the AI needs to switch in a Pokémon (after something faints or similar) it will calculate the switch-in score of each of it's own Pokémon against the player's Pokémon that is out at the time. It will then send out the Pokémon with the highest switch-in score. In case of ties it will go to the first Pokémon in party order.
